# compilerProject
build a c compiler

## how to build
run make in the src directory

## project structure
src: contains all the .y .l .c .cpp file
include: contains all the header file .hpp
test: contain some test file

## how to test
fun the test.sh in the src file, it will test the compiler by the test file contained in the test directory


# second part the parser
I'm going to build a c parser start from version 1

## BUGs
quite strange that the tokenizer is right, however the parser, bison file, will receive some extra chars.
